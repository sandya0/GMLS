# Indonesian Address System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of the Indonesian address system across the GMLS (Global Management and Logistics System) Android application. The system replaces simple address text fields with hierarchical dropdown selections specific to Indonesian administrative divisions.

## Key Features

### 🇮🇩 **Indonesian Administrative Hierarchy**
- **Provinsi** (Province) - 34 provinces of Indonesia
- **Kabupaten/Kota** (Regency/City) - Administrative divisions within provinces
- **Kecamatan** (District) - Sub-divisions within regencies/cities
- **Kelurahan/Desa** (Sub-district/Village) - Smallest administrative units
- **Kode Pos** (Postal Code) - Postal codes for specific areas
- **Detail Alamat** (Detailed Address) - Street address, RT/RW, house number

### 🎯 **Hierarchical Selection**
- Cascading dropdowns that filter options based on parent selection
- Province selection enables regency/city options
- Regency/city selection enables district options
- District selection enables sub-district and postal code options
- All selections use Indonesian terminology

### 📍 **Comprehensive Coverage**
- All 34 provinces of Indonesia included
- Major cities and regencies with detailed subdivisions
- Sample data for Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya, and other major cities
- Extensible structure for adding more locations

## Implementation Details
